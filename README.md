This README contains only simple and quick explanation for what must be done
to install the software.
So we asume that all required hardware components have been gathered, the hardware
setup is complete and only the software installation is left.
For more information regarding the installation and build of systems software
and hardware components consult the Wiki tab above.

The main <> Code tab contains only 1 one folder and two files.
The folder contains the installation script, configuration files, main programmes
and necessary libraries.
The two files are for the RPi os.

The first thing that must be done is downloading the rasbian os from the following link:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/
pick the one with desktop and recommended software. This may take a few minutes.

Now insert the SD card into the PC's SD card port.
